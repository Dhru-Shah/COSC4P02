Project Proposal

VR


MVP minimal viable product 

Step 1: Get the information, show the user the information and allow access to it, 2D hallway and 2D room, visit the museum,  
Step 2: Compartmentalize it, Start of 3D virtual space without functionality, i.e. have the 2D timeline still but click on each room to open a 3D Space. In the 3D space, present the artifacts as 2D pictures.
Step 3: Because we want to focus on artifacts, in this stage we will make the artifacts 3D and the rooms visually appealing. Upvoting features, metadata customization of rooms, 

Problem: 

The problem we aim to address with this project is the lack of a seamless method for information sharing among museums and historical regions. Our goal is to develop a solution that facilitates communication and collaboration among these institutions, with the ultimate objective of increasing user engagement and interaction with museums. This project aims to break down barriers that currently exist, making it easier for visitors to access a wide range of historical information and resources. We believe that this will not only enhance the visitor experience, but also promote greater understanding and appreciation of our shared cultural heritage.



Description

Our product, an interactive timeline, offers users a unique and immersive experience in exploring the historical artifacts of the Niagara region. Utilizing virtual 3D technology, the timeline presents real-life artifacts in a dynamic and interactive manner. Users have the ability to interact with and learn about the artifacts and the time period in which they were created. The virtual space offers a wide range of artifacts, including small items such as hand guns to larger exhibits such as tanks, providing a comprehensive representation of the museum's collection.
In addition to the interactive exhibits, our product also allows users to personalize their experience according to their preferences. Customization options include the ability to organize each room within the virtual space, providing a tailored learning experience. By default, the rooms are organized chronologically, helping users to sequence their historical learning. We believe that this interactive timeline provides a unique and engaging way for visitors to discover and explore the rich history of the Niagara region.


Weekly Standup 
Weekly, every other Tuesday
Will discuss what we did in the previous week and what we will do in the next week
We will also talk about any challenges that we faced
Sprint Planning 
alternating Tuesday

Our timeline for this project utilizes the agile engineering framework with 2 week sprints, where each sprint begins and ends on every other Tuesday. While the sprint review and planning will both happen on biweekly Tuedsayâ€™s, we will also have 3 scrum meetings within the 2 week cycle on tuesdays and thursdays where we will debrief on what has been completed until that point as well as what we will focus on next. 

Overall, we will operate with 2-week sprints containing 3 touchpoint meetings and a sprint review/planning on every other tuesday.
